# Web Research

Use the web_fetch tool to research topics from the internet.

## Workflow
1. Identify a relevant URL for the topic
2. Use `web_fetch` to get the page content
3. Analyze and extract relevant information
4. Save key findings to memory if useful long-term

## Tips
- Wikipedia URLs work well for factual lookups
- For documentation, fetch official docs directly
- If content is truncated, look for specific sub-pages
- Save useful URLs to MEMORY.md for future reference
