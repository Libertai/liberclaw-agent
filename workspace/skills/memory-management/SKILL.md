# Memory Management

How to use the persistent memory system effectively.

## When to Save
- User preferences (name, timezone, interests)
- Project context (what they're working on, key decisions)
- Important facts or references they've shared

## Organizing MEMORY.md
- ## User Profile — name, preferences, style
- ## Projects — active work context
- ## Notes — important facts and references

## Daily Notes
Session-specific context goes in memory/YYYY-MM-DD.md.
Long-term insights should go in MEMORY.md.
